<b>Maximum voltage</b><br/>
<br/>
Maximum battery voltage. If the battery voltage is exceeded, the controller won't turn on.<br/>
Also, the controller will not exceed this limit when regeneratively braking.<br/>
<br/>
Max value (77.6) works as 'Unlimited'.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Important: If the battery has upper-voltage cutoff, it is recommended to set this value below maximum to protect the controller, as braking with cut-off battery may cause severe damage to controller parts.
