<b>Battery current</b><br/>
<br/>
Maximum current that will be drawn from your battery.<br/>
<br/>
Increasing this value increases your bike performance - acceleration and (possibly) maximum speed.<br/>
<br/>
This must not exceed maximum allowed current stated in the battery specifications. Exceeding maximum current may damage the battery.
